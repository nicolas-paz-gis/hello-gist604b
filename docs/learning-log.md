## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create a repository, create and add files.
- Issues help collaboration projects by communiting with teammates a clear workflow for solutions.
- Documentation helps with understanding the steps involved within the workflow.

## Challenges and Solutions
The biggest challenge for me was understanding the submission validation workflow when it failed. I overcame this by carefully looking over the annotations multiple times.

## Connection to My GIS Career
GitHub skills are an important in advancing in my GIS career because it allows us to gain experience in a team environment.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
